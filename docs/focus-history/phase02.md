Summary

  I have successfully implemented API integration and single file compression for the TinyPNG CLI tool.
  Here's what was completed:

  ✅ Core Features Implemented:

  1. TinyPNG API Integration (src/compression/index.js):
    - Complete compression functionality with retry mechanism
    - API key validation and usage tracking
    - Support for metadata preservation and format conversion
    - Error handling for all TinyPNG API error types
  2. File Operations Module (src/utils/fileOps.js):
    - File validation with format checking and header validation
    - Automatic backup system to ./original/ directory
    - Support for all TinyPNG formats (PNG, JPEG, WebP, AVIF)
    - File size formatting and processing utilities
  3. Single File Compression Command (src/commands/compress.js):
    - --file <path> --api-key <name> command implementation
    - Automatic file backup before compression
    - Real-time compression statistics and savings display
    - Usage tracking with config file updates
  4. Comprehensive Error Handling (src/utils/errorHandler.js):
    - Detailed error messages for all failure scenarios
    - Helpful suggestions for resolving issues
    - Proper handling of API limits, network errors, and file system issues
  5. Updated Configuration System:
    - Made all config operations async for consistency
    - Enhanced error handling for configuration issues

  ✅ Key Functionality:

  - Single File Compression: tinypng-compress --file logo.png --api-key client1
  - Metadata Preservation: --preserve-metadata flag support
  - Format Conversion: --convert webp flag support
  - Automatic Backup: Original files saved to ./original/ directory
  - Usage Tracking: API key usage automatically updated after compression
  - Error Handling: Clear error messages with actionable suggestions

  ✅ Testing Verified:

  - ✅ File validation (non-existent files, invalid formats)
  - ✅ API key validation (missing keys, invalid keys)
  - ✅ Error message formatting and suggestions
  - ✅ Configuration loading and status checking
  - ✅ Command argument validation

  The implementation follows the specifications in the reference documents and provides a robust foundation
  for the TinyPNG compression tool. Single file compression is now fully functional with proper error
  handling, automatic backups, and usage tracking.

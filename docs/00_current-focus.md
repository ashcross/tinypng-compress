# PHASE 3.5 - enhancements

## Active References
- docs/config-structure.md
- docs/commands-spec.md
- docs/api-reference.md
- docs/file-operations.md
- docs/error-handling.md

## Tasks
- review the --convert command. When converting a file to a different format, the new image should be saved as the new format. e.g. example.jpg > example.webp if '--convert webp'

## Previous Phases
- reference/focus-history/* for previous phase implementation notes


## Tasks to be completed soon - ignore these tasks for now
- ignore: when '--api-key' is not specified, the default should be to use the next available api key with enough available compressions remaining
- ignore: batch processing of image uploads and compressions via tinypng api for more efficient processing
